# digitalPlatform
POC for digital platform

##Steps to run the project:
- clone/download the repository
- run `npm install`
- To start the gulpfile and its watch tasks run `gulp`

### note
There is no server incorporated with the gulpfile, so you have to run the project using brackets. Later, browsersync will be added to gulp tasks.
